C - Functions, nested loops
In this project, I learned about nested loops, header files, and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and defining my own functions.

Helper File 🙌
_putchar.c: C function that writes a character to stdout.
Header File 📁
holberton.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
